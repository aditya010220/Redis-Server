- Node.js (v14 or later recommended)
- Redis installed and running
- npm (Node Package Manager)


## Installation

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
```

2.Install dependencies:
```bash
 npm install
```
3.Start the Redis server (if not already running):
```bash
